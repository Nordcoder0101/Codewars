#Insert Dashes

This Kata is about inserting dashes into consecutive odd numbers.

Take a series of digets convert them to a string.

Convert the new string into an array separated by each individual diget.

Check to see if there is a remainder on each diget in the array, if there is a remainder assign it to the oddArray.

Compare if 2 odd numbers are in sequence, if yes, add a dash and join the finally array with dashes.
