Take a string of words and make a value for each letter having 'A' be 0, 'B' as 1, so on so forth.

Separate the words and add the value of each letter in the words.

Compare each value moving from the back of the array to the front.  This is to ensure that if two words have the same value, we will always return the words that comes first in the sentence.

Return the word with the highest value.
